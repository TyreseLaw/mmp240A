Turn the heat to high and when boiling, turn the heat off and let the eggs sit in the hot water for 10 minutes. Promptly use a slotted spoon (keep the hot water in the pot) to remove the eggs and peel the egg under cold running water. Slice each egg in half.</li>
  		<h3>Cook the vegetables</h3>

  			<li>
  				<ul>
  					<li>Return the same pot of water to a boil. Add the ramen noodles and cook according to package instructions (most ramen noodles only take 3 minutes to cook.) Drain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking.</li>
  					<li>Divide the noodles, hardboiled eggs, bamboo shoots, corn, spinach and bean sprouts among 4 large serving bowls.</li>
  				</ul>
  			</li>
  		<h3>Make the miso soup</h3>
  			<li>In a large pot, add the stock, instant dashi and soy sauce. Bring to a boil over high heat. Remove from the heat and stir in the miso. Taste the soup and add an additional 1 to 2 tablespoons of miso if youâ€™d like. Ladle soup into each bowl. Top each bowl with green onions.</li>
